 # Weather Scraper (mini-project)

## Description:

A location based weather app to show the below for a user's location:

    * Current weather conditions.
    * Wind speed.
    * Temperature.
    * Sunrise/Sunset (unless already occured).
    
 ## Deployment Link:

## Project Aims:

    * To put my JavaScript skills to use.
    * To practice calling and fetching data from an API.
    * To practice manipulating the DOM.
    * To make something useful and enjoy doing it!

## Wireframe:

HTML and CSS weren't my priority for this project so I wanted to keep the design clean and simple as per my Wireframe below:

## Current Issues:

N/A - all resolved.

## Resolved Issues:

1. Browser (Chrome) not asking permission to access user location. 
    * Re-opened live server in Safari but Safari doesnt ask for permission to access location either.
    * Confirmed Chrome & Safari had permission to access my location on my Mac.
    * Realised I hadn't correctly used string interpolation for the locationData URL; so corrected URL.
    * Code wrapped in try-catch and only error is:

    ```json
    {
    window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    ^

    ReferenceError: window is not defined
    }
    ```

    * Created new API key.
    * Added "navigator.permissions.request" but still no luck.
    * Many browsers currently not supporting Permission API so reverted back to Geolocation API.

    Solution:
    * 'require('dotenv').config()' and hiding the API Key in .env was the issue as I don't have a bundler. For the time being I'll continue without hiding the API key and look to add a bundler at a later stage.

2. Console message of "[Violation] Only request geolocation information in response to a user gesture" and no location data logged in console.
    * It would appear being able to request a users geolocation on page load has been removed: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/geolocation-on-start/

    Solution:
    * Button added which user has to press to then be prompted to allow access to location.
